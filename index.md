# Windo
## Manager | Front End Engineer
### Managing People, building apps using Vue, Node JS, rethinkdb, and doing some other things
I've been in Simulation Industry for approximately 10 years-ish, during that period, I was mostly given roles to manage peoples using various tools like JIRA, Confluence, Trello, Gitlab and so on.

On the other side I manage to learn skills in **Front-End Engineering** with technologies like **HTML**, **CSS/SCSS**, **Javascript**, **Vue**, and also some Back-End technologies like **Node JS**, **Rethinkdb**, and even **linux terminal**. And So I given chance to also work on some Company's project as **Full Stack Engineer** and **Front End Developer**.
